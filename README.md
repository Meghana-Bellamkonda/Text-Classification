# Text-Classification
The project involves the application of text classification using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classification method. 
This technique is a probabilistic approach widely used for categorizing textual data into predefined classes - spam or not spam.
By analyzing the frequency of words within documents and considering their probabilistic relationships, the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm efficiently learns and predicts the classification of new text inputs.
